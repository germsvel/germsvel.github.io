      <p>Web frameworks like Rails have made it very easy for developers to get a simple application up and running. It is fantastic! But for a new developer like myself, it is also a double edged sword. Since it is so effortless to get a simple application up and running, it is also extremely easy to think that you’ve become a real developer in a matter of months and to stop learning.</p>

<p>The power that is at your fingertips and the amazing demand for your newly learned skills can make you arrogant. And arrogance is blinding. New developers are deceived, and easily forget, that they’re not quite real developers. Not yet anyway. Just because the application works right now, it does not mean that you are writing good, object-oriented code or that you will be able to extend and improve the application in the future.</p>

<p>So how can you safeguard yourself against that arrogance and writing poor code? I think the answer is that you must always strive to keep on learning. I know that sometimes it is hard to do so when everything else in the world is also calling for your attention. Do it in small breaks, if that’s all you can do. Listen to podcasts on your commute to work, or read a book before you go to bed. Regardless of how much you learn, developing the habit of learning constantly is, I think, the key to becoming a good developer. As a new developer, you cannot write good code. You just don’t know how to. And learning, apart from helping you to write better code, will keep you humble. Because we all know that the more you learn, the more you realize how little you know.</p>

<p>I know all of this because I am a new developer. I have only been programming in Ruby for 7 months and doing Rails for 6, and I have experienced that sweet sensation feeding your ego when everyone is praising you for your newly built app. So my advice to all new developers, those who are less experienced than I am as well as those who are more experienced, is to read a lot, to do side projects, to find mentors who can guide you and help you in times of confusion, and to become comfortable with asking questions. It’s better to openly admit your ignorance and learn than to be secretly confused. And always, always keep on learning. At least that’s what I’m trying to do.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about what I’m currently reading to learn how to write better code, here’s a few links to books and articles that I’ve been reading:</p>
