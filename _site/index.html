          <div class='blog-post-excerpt'><p>Lately I have read and heard a lot of people talk about using <code>super</code> to extend behavior instead of using callbacks in Rails. The complaint is that callbacks are hard to test and often violate the simple responsibility principle. Finally, I have heard it said that “super is more OOPish”. I don’t believe that to be wholly true. Let me explain why.</p></div>

          <div class='blog-post-excerpt'><p>As a developer, I am constantly trying to improve not only the quality and design of my code but also my understanding of application development as a whole. So, last week I attended a prototyping lesson at Intelligent.ly taught by Maggie Steciuk, the lead designer at Terrible Labs. Prototyping, I learned, helps us in two very important areas: it helps us to better communicate with clients and with team members, and it helps us to better understand ideas, especially our own.</p></div>

          <div class='blog-post-excerpt'><p>This past Thursday, July the 18th, marked a decade since my family moved to the U.S. It is impressive to realize how fast time has gone by and extremely humbling to look back at all the friendships and relationships that I have formed. I came as a boy of fourteen whose entire life had been uprooted and whose friendships had all vanished within a six hour flight to Miami. I am now a man utterly thankful for those who have been around me throughout the last ten years, who through pain, tears, laughter, merriment, friendship, fights, disagreements, and myriad experiences have helped shape the man I have become.</p></div>

          <div class='blog-post-date'>July 14, 2013</div>
          <div class='blog-post-excerpt'><p>Web frameworks like Rails have made it very easy for developers to get a simple application up and running. It is fantastic! But for a new developer like myself, it is also a double edged sword. Since it is so effortless to get a simple application up and running, it is also extremely easy to think that you’ve become a real developer in a matter of months and to stop learning.</p></div>
