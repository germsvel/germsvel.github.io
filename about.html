  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I was a graduate student in economics when I decided to drop everything and become a developer. I havenâ€™t regretted the decision or looked back since. After learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, I am as excited as ever to learn, to code, and to create.</p>

  <p>A few months ago, I decided to join the <a href="http://www.startupinstitute.com" target="_blank">Startup Institute</a> to become a better programmer and increase my knowledge of Rails. While there, I also learned how to work and thrive at a startup. If you're curious about what I liked most about my experience there, you can read <a href="http://germsvel.tumblr.com/post/49160780925/so-how-was-the-startup-institutes-program" target="_blank">this blog post</a> I wrote a little while back.</p>

  <p>Currently, I am interning at <a href="http://www.promoboxx.com" target="_blank">Promoboxx</a>, an awesome startup located in the south end of Boston. I am learning from some amazing developers, working with an extremely talented team, and I consider myself truly lucky to be there.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in talking to me, in what I'm working on, or have more general questions about myself, my adventures, or my experience at the Startup Institute, follow me on tumblr or twitter, or just feel free to contact me.</p>
