Recently, [thoughtbot] decided to make [Upcase free]. It has a lot of great
learning materials, especially when it comes to Rails, vim, test-driven
development, and tmux.

A while ago, I was fortunate enough to be able to record a couple of Elixir
videos for the weekly-iteration portion of it. Since access is now free, I
thought I should share them!

The first one is about the fundamentals of [concurrency in Elixir]. It's a
walk-through of concurrency primitives in Elixir, including message passing,
links, and some of the fundamentals of how Elixir creates fault tolerance.

The second one is about [data abstractions in Elixir]. It's a brief look at how
we can use modules to encapsulate a lot of related functions that act upon the
same data structures. And then we look at how to use protocols to create
higher-level data types.

I hope you enjoy them!
