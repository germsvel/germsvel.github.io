As a developer, I am constantly trying to improve not only the quality and design of my code but also my understanding of application development as a whole. So, last week I attended a prototyping lesson at Intelligent.ly taught by Maggie Steciuk, the lead designer at Terrible Labs. Prototyping, I learned, helps us in two very important areas: it helps us to better communicate with clients and with team members, and it helps us to better understand ideas, especially our own.

“People understand what they can see,” Maggie told us. That phrase made something click inside me, as if I now understood some previously hidden mystery. I much prefer watching a video than reading a few paragraphs on a business’s website to find out what the company or product does. Images can communicate ideas with fantastic clarity. Take the old adage that “a picture is worth a thousand words.” The same truth holds for prototyping because prototyping is putting ideas into images. Showing a client what you are thinking is far better than telling them what you are thinking. There is much less room for misunderstanding and miscommunication. It is a way of saying to your client, “based on what you’ve told us, this is what we are thinking. What is your opinion?” Or it is a way of telling your developers, “this is the concept of what I want this new feature to be.” The developers then have a clear vision of what they have to create.

Prototyping also helps us better understand ideas, especially our own. Have you ever had a thought that you believed was complete and well formed in your mind only to find out that once you had to put it on paper you didn’t even know where to start? Well the same is true of concepts or ideas for applications and their features. People often think they know exactly what they want. But it is not until they are trying to draw it on paper that they realize they only have a very vague idea in their minds. Prototyping allows you to give your idea a body, a structure, a life outside of your head.

It is thus that prototyping helps us understand our own ideas. Prototyping forces us to think through our ideas, to look at angles previously unexplored, to conceive of different scenarios that your user might face. “We can’t think our way to solutions, but we can discover our way to solutions [through iterative prototyping].” In class we were encouraged to draw at least four different prototypes of each page of the web or mobile app so that we could refine our thoughts and the design of our application. This iterative prototyping, turns out, is fundamental to having a successful design process.

Yesterday, I decided to put my new knowledge to the test and prototype an application I’ve been thinking about making for a little while; it’s an application that would help me keep track of where I am in a reading plan I have been following. I included some samples of my sketches below.

You can see in the first image that I went through several iterations of the main page of my application, finally arriving at what I think will give the user the best experience. I also sketched some other parts of the application, including some ideas for the transition of screens.

The most beautiful thing is that it only took me about an hour to sketch most of these, it drastically clarified the concept of the application in my mind, and I was able to immediately communicate my idea to my friend, who upon seeing the sketches decided to join me in building the application. Thus, my very short experiment with prototyping already gave me a fantastic glimpse into the power prototyping has for understanding and communicating ideas.
