This past Thursday, July the 18th, marked a decade since my family moved to the U.S. It is impressive to realize how fast time has gone by and extremely humbling to look back at all the friendships and relationships that I have formed. I came as a boy of fourteen whose entire life had been uprooted and whose friendships had all vanished within a six hour flight to Miami. I am now a man utterly thankful for those who have been around me throughout the last ten years, who through pain, tears, laughter, merriment, friendship, fights, disagreements, and myriad experiences have helped shape the man I have become.

I thank God for what I can only describe as his providence, for his guidance, though most times I didn’t realize he was guiding me. The past ten years are something I could have never foreseen. And yet, when I look back from this vantage point, I see a series of occurrences that are tied by a common thread, and I cannot describe them in any other way.

And I have to thank those who, through the years, have been a part of my life. I will likely forget to list some of their names, but I would still like to thank them, though they may never know how much I owe them for who I am. Thank you AJ, Tate, Choi, Hector, Josh, Kryz, Henrique, Sam, Lauren, Luke, Michele, friends from high school, college, and graduate school, friends from the Startup Institute, and many, many others I met during these last ten years. Thank you friends from Bolivia who made the phone calls and wrote the emails, who received me gladly when I returned to visit my homeland; thank you Pancho, Dan, Lu, Mia, Cecy, Tify, Ness, Chichy, Jessica and innumerable other cousins.

Finally, I have to thank my family, my parents, my brothers, and my sister, without whom I do not know where I’d be. They have all been an amazing source of inspiration, a pillar of strength, a fountain of wisdom, and examples of how I should live my life. Without them I would have lost myself a long time ago. They are an integral part of who I am.

Thank you all, named and unnamed, who have helped me, met me, talked to me, or shared something with me, a memory, a story, an anecdote, or even a handshake. Thank you because for the last ten years, though I have lived in several cities, and I have moved more than I’d like to recall, I have somehow found a place that I call home.
