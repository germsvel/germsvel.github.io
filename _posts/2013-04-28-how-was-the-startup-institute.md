I could give you some facts like the number of tracks there are, the schedule we followed, who came to teach, etc. But I think it is much more interesting to tell you what I got out of it, what I experienced, what I took with me.



“So how was the program?” you ask. Well, it was transformative. Eight weeks ago I walked into a room full of strangers thinking, “What am I doing here? What am I getting myself into?” To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t even sure what to expect from the program. Two days ago, I came out of the same room with the sad feeling that I was leaving home and that I was parting with my family.



Yep, that’s right. My family grew by 51 people in eight weeks. That’s what the program did for me. If I could only credit Aaron, Shaun, and the rest of the awesome SIB team for one thing, it would have to be for their amazing ability to judge character. I don’t know how or why they chose the people they did, but the truth is that a connection existed between the students from the very beginning, even if we weren’t aware of it at the time. We all had a secret thread that connected us. And over the eight weeks, that thread became a bond that is now unbreakable.



Now you may be wondering, “Isn’t the program about learning? Who cares about expanding your family?” Well, yeah. There’s a lot learning too. A ton, in fact. The interesting part is that it won’t all come the way you expect it to. It won’t all come from sitting in a chair, listening to someone who’s writing on a blackboard. It will come from living and breathing that environment, from sharing your life with those people. And as for that family, they will be doing a lot of the teaching, perhaps inadvertently but many times intentionally. Like a wise man once said, “who I am is not as important as who I am with”. I’m not sure if that’s always true, but I think there’s a lot of truth in that. The people you are with determine a lot about you; they help shape and mold you. Oh and by the way, that wise man is JFL, one of those new members of my family.



That’s not to say I haven’t learned a lot of new skills. I can go on and on about how much I learned from instructors who practice what they teach, who work every day using the same tools they are teaching me to use. I can go on and on about how I improved as a Rails developer, how I learned how to pair program, how I learned TDD, how I learned to work in teams, how I learned to use git and github effectively, how I learned from countless entrepreneurs what it’s like to be in a startup, the ups and downs, the good and the bad.



But the program was so much more than that. I said it was transformative, not just a learning experience. The skills I learned are just that, skills. Things you can learn. But I feel as though I came out of the Startup Institute older, somehow wiser, grown up. I don’t know what it is, but I know I am not the same person that went in.


So as I get ready to start my first week outside of the program, I know that what the program did for me didn’t stop on Friday when we graduated. I know that over the next months, maybe years, I will reap benefits from the Startup Institute. As I get ready, I cannot help but think of my new brothers and sisters, of those trained in battle the last eight weeks, of those who shared their dreams with me and who accepted me as one of their own. I cannot help but think of them and smile because I know that we will always be family and that tomorrow we will go out and conquer our dreams. We will conquer those three things that we set our minds to, and that most important of all, we will be there for each other when a shoulder is needed.
