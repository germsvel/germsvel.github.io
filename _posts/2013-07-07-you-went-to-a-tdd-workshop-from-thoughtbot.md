Last week, part of Promoboxx’s engineering team went to thoughtbot’s Test-Driven Rails workshop. It was a workshop I really wanted to take, and something I had been hoping we’d do as a team since I first joined Promoboxx as an intern a month and a half ago.

The workshop lasted two days, and it consisted of building two simple apps. During the first day, we learned how to consistently follow the red-green-refactor cycle, letting our tests guide our development of the application, and we learned how to test from the outside-in, using capybara for acceptance tests and rspec for unit tests.

The second day was much harder but equally interesting. We learned how to do tdd when we integrate third party services into our application, which in turn led us to explore stubs, mocks, spies, and fakes. We also kept practicing the red-green-refactor cycle and testing from the outside-in, forcing the practices to become habits.

Learning so much about test-driven development in two days was really an amazing experience. It was also a very humbling one: it is always impressive to see a master of his craft make routine of what you consider difficult. And Josh Clayton definitely did that with test-driven development. As one of the main contributors to factory_girl, if not the main contributor, I do not think Josh’s credentials for tdd can be questioned. But seeing him work alongside the class was like watching Messi play soccer: we both play the game, but when I watch Messi play, I realize how soccer is meant to be played and how beautiful the game can be.

This brings me to one last thing I want to comment about the workshop. Aside from the amazing content we got to learn, it was a fantastic experience to be able to go to the thoughtbot office and learn, interact, and chat with Josh and other thoughtbotters who were around. I would recommend every Rails developer to take the course, and you can do so online. But I would encourage those who live in Boston to take the opportunity to attend the course in person. Take advantage of living in an amazing city like Boston. Someday your path may take you elsewhere, where all you can do is take courses and workshops online. And that’s perfectly fine. But while you are here, go to learn.thoughtbot.com, sign up for learn prime, and go to the next Test-Driven Rails in-person workshop.
